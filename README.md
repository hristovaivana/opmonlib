* create a software work area
  * see https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/appfwk/wiki/Compiling-and-running-under-v1.2.1
* those instructions should already help you to clone opmonlib to the right directory
* build the software
  * `. ./setup_build_environment`
  * `./build_daq_software.sh --install`
* you can run some examples in another shell
  * `. ./setup_runtime_environment`
  * `opmonlib_test`
